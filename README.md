This repository contains the Mathematica notebooks and module used in the paper *FFT and orthogonal discrete transform on weight lattices of semi-simple Lie groups* by Bastian Seifert, available under https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.06254 , for the calculation of the basis changes in the appendix. 

The file C2Transformation4x4.nb contains an explicit calculation of the decomposition of the C2 DCT of degree 4, i.e. the decomposition of the corresponding 10x10 matrix.
